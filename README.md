# Jeep_Dev
The idea is to create a touchscreen interface for controlling (simple on|off or multimode) lights, horns (any relay driven) and other API driven light sources
WLED will be the primary integration focus initially for API interfaces

# Jeep_Simple

Contains the initial light class with two inheriting classes FogMM (a 6 mode light) and Spots (simple On|Off) controling 4 30V 10A relay boards that have a logic level of 3.3V. In Nextion folder there is a Visio Doc that was used to create the user interface, the TFT and HMI files for Nextion 4.3 basic display and an images folder used for the GUI.
